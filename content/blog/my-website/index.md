## Moving My Personal Website to Hugo
Over time, I realized that maintaining a simple static website wasn’t ideal for managing content efficiently. Adding or updating content became a chore, and I needed a better way to handle things. That’s when I discovered Hugo and its rich collection of themes, and everything changed.

Hugo provides a fantastic markdown-based interface to add and modify content, making it incredibly easy to work with. I decided to move my personal website to Hugo and selected the [Qubt](https://github.com/chrede88/qubt) theme by [Christian Olsen](https://github.com/chrede88) for the implementation.

## Why Hugo?
Hugo offers several advantages over traditional static websites:

1. **Markdown Simplicity**  
 Write content in plain markdown without fiddling with HTML/CSS/JS or any framework.
2. **Fast Setup**   
Hugo’s themes make designing and deploying a website straightforward.
3. **Rich Themes**   
There’s a theme for every style and purpose, and the Qubt theme really resonated with what I wanted.

## About the Qubt Theme
The Qubt theme, designed by [Christian Olsen](https://github.com/chrede88), is clean, modern, and perfect for personal websites. It’s minimal yet functional, with just the right balance of style and usability.

## Shoutout to [Christian Olsen](https://github.com/chrede88)
A big thanks to Christian for creating such an excellent theme. I appreciate the effort he has put into making this and other projects, which you can find on his GitHub profile. He’s also a homelaber, which makes his work even more inspiring for tech enthusiasts.
