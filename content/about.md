Iâ€™m a Robotics Software Developer based in Augsburg, GermanyðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª, originally from a small town called Yellapur in IndiaðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³. Right now, Iâ€™m working with [Lemvos GmbH](https://lemvos.com/), building a generic, ROS 2-native robotic controller for outdoor mobile robots on the Nvidia Jetson platform. Itâ€™s a lot of fun and keeps me deep in the world of embedded systems.

I studied Mechatronics at the [Technical University of Applied Sciences WÃ¼rzburg-Schweinfurt](https://www.thws.de/), which really kicked off my love for tech and robotics. Iâ€™m especially interested in the low-level workings of computer systems, and Iâ€™m a big fan of open-source projects and Linux. Not an Arch guy thoughðŸ˜….
