Iâ€™m a Software Engineer based in Augsburg, Germany :de:, originally from a small town called Yellapur in India :india:. Right now, Iâ€™m working at [Canonical](https://canonical.com/), porting Ubuntu on to arm64 hardware platforms.

I studied Mechatronics at the [Technical University of Applied Sciences WÃ¼rzburg-Schweinfurt](https://www.thws.de/), which really kicked off my love for tech and robotics. Iâ€™m especially interested in the low-level workings of computer systems, and Iâ€™m a big fan of open-source projects and Linux. Not an Arch guy thoughðŸ˜….
